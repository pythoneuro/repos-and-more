# Pythoneuro
The list of great Python packages I have posted on [my twitter account](https://twitter.com/pythoneuro) is continually being updated.

My goal is to promote python as the leading language for coding and analyzing in the neuroscience field! üß†üßë‚Äçüéìüë©‚Äçüíª
I also love and support open science ‚ù§Ô∏è

If you're working on a cool neuroscience Python project, feel free to add yourself through a pull request/tag me or contact me on Twitter.
